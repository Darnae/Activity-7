Approximate Pi


This assignment was relatively simple to execute. I was tasked with a windows form that prompts the user to enter a number of terms for a sequence of PI. Coding requirements was that I must use a for loop and not round my answer.  The goal of this assigment was to approximate PI with the inputed terms. All of this was to be displayed in various text boxes, which I have done.

Included in my screen shots are my Code for the assigment, and three test runs. I had to do at least one test run using a value between 1-10, 100-300, and 1000-3000. I provided the screenshots to each test run with the exact number used.
